                  <p>In July of 2023, I went on my first international trip to London and Paris. I went with one of my closest friends, Erin. She was originally my brother's friend but eventually found the error of her ways and became MY friend. We have known each other for about 15 years.</p>

                  <h2>Off To Paris We Go</h2>
                  <p>Our first leg of the trip was to Paris. We boarded our flights out of STL and had a layover in Charlotte. Charlotte was lovely and their airport had crazy amount of high-end shopping! Unfortunately, we had no time and had to hustle to our gate.</p>

                  <h2>Now to London</h2>
                  <p>Now we were on our way to London! To get to London, we took the EuroStar train. The train was a great time for us to sit back and relax from our all walking in Paris. In London, we had a nice 4 star hotel off Vincent Square in Westminster. Some highlights of our London trips were seeing Big Ben, riding the London Eye, walking the Borough Market, Tower of London, Horse Guards Parade, watching Wicked and Lion King shows, and attending BOTH Cardinals versus Cubs games!</p>

                  <h2>Stateside Bound</h2>
                  <p>Now on our way home! We were beyond exhausted but had the time of our lives. Of course, I like to live on the wild side and did not pack my liquids into separate bags as I was instructed to by British Airways. (Note: Don't do what I did). Was accousted by  baggage security, because, well, I tend to see how far I can push the limit. They didn't find my expensive perfume that I bought in Paris, thank goodness. A lesson learned to always play by the rules! Now to plan our next trip!</p>
